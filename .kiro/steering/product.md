# Product Overview

Trello MCP Server is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides programmatic access to Trello's API. It enables developers to manage Trello boards, lists, cards, and organizations directly from any MCP-compatible client without context switching.

The server handles OAuth authentication automatically, caching tokens securely for seamless access. It supports both interactive (browser-based) and manual authentication flows, making it suitable for desktop and headless environments.

Key use cases include task automation, project management integration, team workflow orchestration, and CI/CD pipeline integration with Trello boards.
